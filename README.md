**jellyfish** is an interactive game inspired by 1920s Surrealist painting. The player controls a "jellyfish" to catch "ants" before they escape beyond the horizon.

**jellyfish** is built using *cow*, a graphics programming language created by [James Bern](https://james-bern.github.io/), Professor of Computer Science at Williams College.
